playoffs. And other 4 playing play-in and 2 winners are goes to playoffs. In out case I wanted to filter teams by normal season standings. But if teams has a same win rate, standings are determining by matches between the teams which has a same win rate. But to calculate that I needed to imports \"head to head\" data and looping all teams which has a same win rate by matches. Still doable but I don't think that its so worth it to calculate. Instead of I used \"playoffs_season player csv\" which I imported at top of the research for future researches and filtered teams by playoffs season players teams. With that way, still standings are little different than normal season standings but  I filtered teams which played in playoff season after play-in games.\nAs we see, not so much thing is changed in eastern conference but in western conference, PHX is out and LAL is in now. Still , maybe I can do other way at future but I believe this is beter with that way.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"69ed42d7-a8c5-454b-8190-8529424b67be"},{"source":"eastern_players = pd.merge(advanced_standings_western, eff_n, left_on=\"Team\", right_on=\"Tm\")\neastern_players[[\"Player\", \"EFF\", \"Tm\", \"Category\"]]\nwestern_players = pd.merge(advanced_standings_western, eff_n, left_on=\"Team\", right_on=\"Tm\")\nwestern_players[[\"Player\", \"EFF\", \"Tm\", \"Category\"]]","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":50,"lastExecutedAt":1718069474996,"lastExecutedByKernel":"419e0876-89de-4c74-a60f-6675a5fb3666","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"eastern_players = pd.merge(advanced_standings_western, eff_n, left_on=\"Team\", right_on=\"Tm\")\neastern_players[[\"Player\", \"EFF\", \"Tm\", \"Category\"]]\nwestern_players = pd.merge(advanced_standings_western, eff_n, left_on=\"Team\", right_on=\"Tm\")\nwestern_players[[\"Player\", \"EFF\", \"Tm\", \"Category\"]]","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":321,"type":"dataFrame"}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"0c30941e-2f2b-4843-8669-1cd221c0e87a","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"Player","type":"string"},{"name":"EFF","type":"number"},{"name":"Tm","type":"string"},{"name":"Category","type":"any","constraints":{"enum":["5-10","10-15","15-20","20-25","25-30","30+"]},"ordered":true}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72],"Player":["Shai Gilgeous-Alexander","Chet Holmgren","Jalen Williams","Josh Giddey","Gordon Hayward","Luguentz Dort","Isaiah Joe","Aaron Wiggins","Cason Wallace","Jaylin Williams","Kenrich Williams","Bismack Biyombo","Nikola Joki?","Jamal Murray","Aaron Gordon","Michael Porter Jr.","Kentavious Caldwell-Pope","Reggie Jackson","Christian Braun","Peyton Watson","DeAndre Jordan","Rudy Gobert","Anthony Edwards","Karl-Anthony Towns","Mike Conley","Naz Reid","Kyle Anderson","Jaden McDaniels","Nickeil Alexander-Walker","Monte Morris","Jordan McLaughlin","Kawhi Leonard","James Harden","Paul George","Ivica Zubac","Russell Westbrook","Norman Powell","Terance Mann","Mason Plumlee","Amir Coffey","Luka Don?i?","Kyrie Irving","Daniel Gafford","Dereck Lively II","P.J.
